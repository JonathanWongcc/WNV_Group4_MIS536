# WNV_Group4_MIS536
## Project Description

The Chicago Department of Public Health maintains an environmental surveillance program for West Nile Virus (WNV). This program includes the collection of mosquitoes from traps located throughout the city; the identification and sorting of mosquitoes collected from these traps; and the testing of specific species of mosquitoes for WNV. List of locations and test results for pools of mosquitoes tested through the Chicago Department of Public Health Environmental Health program. We, Team 4, are attempting to find out the correlation between the data variables and predict the results through various models.  

## Data
This project contains the raw data downloaded from Chicago Department of Public Health [website](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/West-Nile-Virus-WNV-Mosquito-Test-Results/jqe8-8r6s/data) as well as processed data attached under the data folder.

#### Data conversion
Result - The outcome converted to build and interpreate the gain chart.

#### Column Drop 
Below columns dropped due to insignificance or redundancy of the information.
- Test Id - Primary key to the table
- Block - Specific address
- Test Date - Test once a week, redundant to week column
- Trap - Trap Id
- Location - Combination of Longitude and Latitude


## Models
The exploration and prediction models are explained under the model section includes Oversampling, GLM, Decision tree, Lift chart and Confusion matrix.

## Reports
#### Mid-Term Reports
The checkpoint1 document and powerpoint slides explain the basic understanding, progress and future goals till the mid-term. 

#### Final Reports
The final report and powerpoint presentations mainly expalin the data processing and model building for predictive analytics.
